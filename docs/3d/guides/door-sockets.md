title: Door sockets
---

In this guide, we will learn about door sockets and how to use them.

> **Note:** This guide lives in the 2D section of the documentation: [here](../../guides/door-sockets.md)
>
> The concepts are the same in the 2D version. The only difference is that in the 3D version, door sockets of individual doors are configured in the `DoorHandler` component.
