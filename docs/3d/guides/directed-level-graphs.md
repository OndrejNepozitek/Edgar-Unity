title: Directed level graphs
---

In this guide, you will see what you can do if yiz make the level graph directed and mark some doors as entrance-only or exit-only.

> **Note:** This guide lives in the 2D section of the documentation: [here](../../guides/directed-level-graphs.md)
>
> The concepts are the same in the 2D version. The only difference is that in the 3D version, the direction of individual doors is configured in the `DoorHandler` component.
