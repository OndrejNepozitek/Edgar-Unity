This section will walk you through the basic setup of the algorithm. We will first see how to create room templates and then learn to use level graphs. After that, we will know everything needed to create an input for the generator so we will see how to actually run the generator. And because the performance of the algorithm is greatly influenced by how we define the input, we will conclude this section with some tips for improving the speed of the algorithm.
