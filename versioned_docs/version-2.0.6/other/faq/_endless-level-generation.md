[//]: # "Is Edgar suitable for endless level generation?"

Short answer: No.

One of the main ideas of Edgar is that you specify the structure of a level with a so-called level graph, and the generator tries to produce a level that conforms to that structure. If the level graph contains 15 rooms, all the generated levels will have exactly 15 rooms. Therefore, it is not possible to generate endless levels using this approach.
