There are basically 2 ways to learn how to use the 3D version of Edgar:

1. You can continue reading the *Basics* section of the documentation, which will guide you through the most important concepts
2. **Recommended:** You can learn by observing how a simple level is generated from scratch with Edgar in the [Basics](../examples/basics.md) tutorial.

**I recommend reading the [Basics](../examples/basics.md) tutorial first** and coming back to individual guides later if you need some more information about the individual concepts.
