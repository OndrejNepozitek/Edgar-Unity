title: Custom input
---

On this page, you will find out how to customize the input for the generator:

- how to add rooms to the level graph programmatically
- how to assign room templates to rooms based on their room type
- how to create level graph procedurally

> **Note:** This guide lives in the 2D section of the documentation: [here](../../guides/custom-editor-controls.md)
>
> The concepts are the same in the 2D version, you just have to replace the `Grid2D` class name suffix with `Grid3D`. For example, `LevelDescriptionGrid2D` -> `LevelDescriptionGrid3D`.
