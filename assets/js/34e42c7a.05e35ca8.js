However, it is not recommended adding room templates that can be used only in very specific scenarios. For example, if you have a secret room that has exactly one door position, you should not add it to the default list. The reason is that the generator might try to use this room template for a room that has multiple neighbours, wasting precious time.

Therefore, the number of cycles greatly affects the performance. Usually, you should start with 0-1 cycles and only increase the number when you are already familiar with the core concepts of Edgar. In the ",(0,a.kt)("a",{parentName:"p",href:"/Edgar-Unity/docs/2.0.2/examples/enter-the-gungeon#level-graphs"},"Enter the Gungeon")," example, you can see levels graphs with up to 3 cycles and the generator is still relatively fast."),(0,a.kt)("p",null,(0,a.kt)("strong",{parentName:"p"},"Avoid interconnected cycles.")," Cycles are hard, but interconnected cycles are even harder. If you want to have multiple cycles in a level graph, make sure that the cycles do not have any rooms in common.
