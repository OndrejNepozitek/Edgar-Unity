And based on that configuration, they generate a random dungeon layout.","sidebar":"docs"},"offline/unity":{"id":"offline/unity","title":"Offline documentation","description":"Welcome to the offline documentation of Edgar."},"other/faq":{"id":"other/faq","title":"FAQ","description":"This document contains solutions to common questions that are often asked on Discord and other channels.","sidebar":"docs"},"recipes/prefabs-in-editor":{"id":"recipes/prefabs-in-editor","title":"Keep prefabs in editor","description":"After a level is generated, each room template prefab that was used in the level goes through the Object.Instantiate() method. This method removes the connection to the original prefab, which basically means that the whole prefab is unpacked (described here in Unity docs.) However, it might be sometimes useful to keep the references to the prefabs. For example, if the level generator is used in the Editor and then manual changes are made to that level.","sidebar":"docs"}}}')}}]);
